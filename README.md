# Bicep samples



I created this repos to show what you can do with Bicep. 

Bicep is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to create ARM Templates and deploy resources in Azure. 
[More information on Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep). The project is still experimental.

Samples work with the current version of Bicep (no in Alpha)

* App Gateway and two VM
* Load Balancer and one VM with a NAT rule



You may also notice the Github Actions workflow. I wanted to see how you can build a CI/CD worklow with Bicep

Note: Bicep is not ready for production
